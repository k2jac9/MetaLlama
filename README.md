We are Care Collective Llama, and we are excited to present our baby: Llama Prob-Llama Helper.

Our mission is simple: to empower doctors with innovative solutions that save time, allowing them to provide better care. Our goal is to transform the lives of millions of families impacted by Alzheimer's.

The problem: Alzheimer's dementia.
There is currently no cure for dementia. In Canada, 750,000 people are living with Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia. Globally, the number stands at 55 million, and it's expected to double every 20 years. This degenerative condition leaves individuals dependent on their loved ones for daily care and support.

Caregivers of dementia patients spend countless hours searching for resources to help their loved ones, often facing a burden that diminishes the quality of life for both the patient and themselves.

We consulted with Dr. Nihal Haque, a geriatrician with extensive experience working with Alzheimer's patients. The consultation process included defining workflows, building foundational knowledge of dementia care, and conducting end-user testing. He also provided us with a list of common questions caregivers and patients often ask.

This process led to the validation of two key use cases:

The Alzheimer's Society of Canada website: This site hosts numerous PDFs with valuable information on dementia care. But navigating through them to find the answers caregivers need is time-consuming and cumbersome.

Physician progress notes: We learned that physicians review 15 to 20 progress notes daily, repeating this process 20 to 30 times a day. For a team of seven doctors, this totals 140 notes daily. With each review taking about 5 minutes, that adds up to hundreds of hours each weekâ€”time that could be better spent on patient care.

That's when we decided to create Llama Helper:

For families: Caregiver-centric, family-friendly, conversational, and supportive.
For doctors: Time-saving, physician-friendly, and burnout-reducing.
